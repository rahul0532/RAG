# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a combination of retrieval and generative AI techniques. The system retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and enhances text generation for better accuracy and contextual understanding.

## Features
- Efficient document retrieval
- Context-aware text generation
- Integration with large language models
- Scalable and customizable

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG.git
   cd RAG
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `RAG.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to run the retrieval and generation process.
3. Modify the retrieval dataset or model parameters as needed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Transformers library
- FAISS (if using vector-based retrieval)
- Any additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
